# MochiJumpWeb-SinglePackageDeployment

This repo holds the code for a single package depolyment.

This is a spring-boot app that serves up an angular front end.

The key to doing this is all maven. If you want to recreate something like this, take a look at the 3 pom.xml files. They are located at root and in each of the sub folder from root.
